Data from the Pisa wordnet.

In the original there are some empty definitions and many wrong
spelled words, all containing apostrophes in place of accented letters
(for example -uniformita' instead of -uniformit√†-).  These were
corrected by Tommaso Petrolito.

ItalWN itself has 49,349 synsets, but only 15,563 ItalWN synsets are
mapped to Princeton WN, and thus included in the OMW.
