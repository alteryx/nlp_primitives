FinnWordNet - the Finnish WordNet
=================================


FinnWordNet
-----------

FinnWordNet is a wordnet for Finnish. It was created by having
professional translators translate the word senses of the Princeton
WordNet (PWN) 3.0 into Finnish and by combining the translations with
the PWN structure. FinnWordNet is a part of the FIN-CLARIN project:
