This directory contains two wordnets for Norwegian Bokmal and Nynorsk.

The main wordnet has a different structure from the Princeton wordnet,
but roughly 5,000 synsets (the core synsets) have been mapped to PWN
in cooperation with the Danish wordnet.   

Thanks to Lars Nygaard for giving us access to these files and helping
us clean them up a little.
