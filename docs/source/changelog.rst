**Future Release** TBD
    * Changes
        * Upgrade to Featuretools 0.20.0 and replace Text variable type with NaturalLanguage (:pr:`34`)
        * Replace nltk corpus download with a `nltk-data.tar` data tarball included during install. :pr:`31`
        * Augment `sdist` to first unpack the data tarball, then include data files in the sdist via `MANIFEST.in` :pr:`31`
        * Ignore unpacked data locally, could be generated by sdist :pr:`31`
    * Testing Changes
        * Add another set of CI jobs which ensure that we can make an nlp_primitives package, install that, and then still pass all the unit tests, vs an editable install :pr:`31`
        * Move some test utils into `test/` :pr:`31`

**v1.0.0** Aug 12, 2020
    * Changes
        * Remove tensorflow and tensorhub as core requirements, but they
        can be installed with ``pip install nlp_primitives[complete]``. The
        ``UniversalSentenceEncoder`` primitive requires the ``nlp_primitives[complete]``
        install but all other primitives work with the standard install. (:pr:`24`)
    * Testing Changes
        * Update CircleCI to perform complete install and use matrix jobs (:pr:`24`)
